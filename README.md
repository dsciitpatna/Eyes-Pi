# Pi Spy - A Raspberry Pi based security camera
This project aims to develop an open source Raspberry Pi based smart security camera system. Other than simple recording of video, we aim to use image processing to automatically extract useful information from the feed. We also aim to make the platform extendable, so that other developers can add their own custom code.

# Features
- Simple video recording
- Video recording on movement
- People count
- Data logging
- Automatic notifications and alerts
- Extendable platform

# Technologies used
- Raspberry Pi and camera module
- OpenCV
- Web

# Impact
Although commercial CCTV cameras are available, they are expensive, difficult to install, and cannot be extended. The use cases for this product consists of:
- Applications where 1-2 cameras are required
- User has to do custom processing on feed
- Applications where the feed has to be monitored remotely
- Applications where automatic data logging is required
- Hobbyists looking for a quick solution
 
# Milestones
- [ ] Install basic software for the Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Connect the camera module and try to get the video feed
- [ ] Basic video and data logging
- [ ] People count
- [ ] Send the feed and associated log data to an external device over the Internet
- [ ] Make an application to view the data remotely
